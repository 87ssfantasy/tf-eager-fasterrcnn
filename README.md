# tf-eager-fasterrcnn

Faster R-CNN R-101-FPN model was implemented with tensorflow eager execution. 

# Requirements

- Cuda 9.0
- Python 3.5
- TensorFlow 1.11
- cv2

# Usage

see `train_model.ipynb` and `inspect_model.ipynb`

# Updating

- [ ] evaluation utils
- [x] training without for-loop when batch size > 1
- [ ] TTA (multi-scale testing, flip and box voting)
- [ ] online hard examples mining
- [ ] multi-scale training
- [ ] soft-nms
- [ ] balanced sampling and negative samples training (maybe)
